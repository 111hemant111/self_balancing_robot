# PID-controlled Self-balancing Robot
This project implements an inverted pendulum concept to build a self-balancing robot. An Inertial Measurement Unit is used to detect the angle of inclination and these values are continuously fed to a PID Controller which would then provide the amount of torque that's needed to be applied in the direction of fall to keep the robot balanced.
## Finished product
![Final product](docs/self_balancing_robot.JPG?raw=true "Final product")
Final product that balances itself on the single axis.

## Scope for improvement
This is a fully functional final version. Following improvements can be made:
1. Smoother balancing.
2. Ability to steer.
Please refer to [schematics](/schematics) to improve upon the progress.
