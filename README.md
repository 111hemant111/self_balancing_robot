# PID-controlled Self-balancing Robot
This project implements an inverted pendulum concept to build a self-balancing robot. An Inertial Measurement Unit is used to detect the angle of inclination and these values are continuously fed to a PID Controller which would then provide the amount of torque that's needed to be applied in the direction of fall to keep the robot balanced.

## Status
Completed. Last update Dec 2017. Refer to 'Scope for Improvement' section.

## Finished product
![Final product](docs/self_balancing_robot.JPG?raw=true "Final product")

## Scope for Improvement
This is a fully functional final version. Following improvements can be made:
1. Smoother balancing.
2. Ability to steer.
Please refer to [schematics](/schematics) and [docs](/docs) to improve upon the progress.
